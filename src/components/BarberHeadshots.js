            <p>
              I come from a blue collar family where college was never a main
              priority so I had no outlook on a future, I just kind of went day
              by day. After high school I tried a few careers I thought I would
              like, from tattooing, culinary arts and videography to engineering
              and factory work, none of which panned out for one reason or
              another.

              The idea of barbering came to be after seeing videos online and
              doing a bit more research about the craft. I went to my sister,
              who's been in the hair industry for over a decade, and after
              talking it over with her, I decided to go for it. I attended the
              Barber/styling College of Lansing to become a licensed Barber.
              School felt like a full time job and while I didn't have a dollar
              to my name I can say it was the best year of my life. I learned to
              live with less and strive for more. If I had to pick a specialty,
              Iâ€™d say maintaining a genuine conversation. In today's world, it's
              a lost art and along with getting a good cut, I want people
              leaving the shop feeling rejuvenated, walking a bit taller and
              have a smile on their face.

              My love of hair artistry started years before I was actually
              licensed in 2002. Weather it was convincing my friends to let me
              color their hair, getting them ready for homecoming or giving them
              a make over after a break up. Hair has just been a natural way in
              which I have been able to show love and support to others while
              expressing my own creativity. In the year 2000 I started an
              apprenticeship program and had great opportunities to study and be
              mentored by extremely talented stylists. I was licensed in 2002
              and throughout the years continued my education. I strive to make
              every client feel comfortable while they're in my chair and and
              confident when they leave, while achieving their hair goals to the
              best of my abilities. I am excited to start this new chapter with
              my brother! If I had known we'd be here one day, I would have
              yelled at him less for cutting the hair off my practice
              mannequins!
